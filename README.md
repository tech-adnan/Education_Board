# Education_Board

**Description:** This project demonstrates the implementation of a program to display details of various education boards in multiple programming languages, including Python, Java, and C#. The program utilizes object-oriented concepts such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation to model the structure and behavior of different types of education boards, like national boards and school boards. By taking user input, the program displays relevant details based on the selected board. Each file adheres to the core principles of its respective language while maintaining consistency in functionality.

All the source files have been packaged in a zip file for easy distribution and cross-platform compatibility.
